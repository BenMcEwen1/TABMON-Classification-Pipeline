## Species Distribution Modelling (SDM)
This directory currently contains two examples of SDM for 1) The Sounds of Norway Project and 2) A simple example related to Joshua Tree distibution [documentation here](https://daniel-furman.github.io/Python-species-distribution-modeling/).

This is new to me, need to figure out how to load european geograph data (`.tif`), masking of borders, find and load covariates and target detections from eBird.
